## Generalized Multiplicative Method (Lab 1)

This project implements two classes of random number generators: Multiplicative Congruential Generator (MCG) and Generalized Multiplicative Method (GMM). It also provides some methods to test and compare the performance of these generators.

### Classes

- `Generator<T>`: An interface that defines a generic random number generator with two methods: `get()` and `reset()`.
- `MultiplicativeCongruentialGenerator<T>`: A class that implements the `Generator<T>` interface and represents a MCG with the formula $$x_{n+1} = ax_n \mod m$$, where $a$ is the multiplier, $m$ is the modulus, and $x_0$ is the initial seed.
- `GeneralizedMultiplicativeMethod<T>`: A class that implements the `Generator<T>` interface and represents a GMM with the formula $$x_{n+1} = x_{n-k}x_n \mod m$$, where $k$ is the lag, $m$ is the modulus, and $x_0, x_1, \dots, x_k$ are the initial seeds. This class uses two MCGs as the primary and secondary generators to fill the initial value table.
- `PearsonsCorrelation`: A simple implementation of Pearson's correlation coefficient. This coefficient measures the linear relationship between two datasets. The formula for Pearson's correlation coefficient is: $$r = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \sum\limits_{i=1}^n (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}$$

## Numerical Integration Approximations (Lab 4)

This Java program approximates definite integrals using Monte Carlo methods.

### Description

This project implements two methods of numerical integration: Monte Carlo method and Simpson's rule. It also provides some methods to calculate and compare the actual and approximate values of some integrals.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Java installed on your system.

### Usage

1. Compile the Java file `Main.java`:
	```bash
	javac Main.java
	```
2. Run the compiled program:
	```bash
	java Main
	```

### Methods

- A static method that prints the prompt, the actual answer, and the approximate answer of an integral to the standard output.
	```java
	Main.print(String prompt, double actualAnswer, double approximateAnswer);
	```
- `Main.integral1()`: A static method that calculates the integral $$\int_0^{\frac{5\pi}{7}} \cos(x + \sin(x)) dx$$
using the Monte Carlo method with 10000 iterations. It calls the `print` method with the result and the actual answer of -0.485736.
- `Main.integral2()`: A static method that calculates the integral $$\iint_{1 \leq x^2 + y^2 \leq 3}\frac{dxdy}{x^2 + y^4}$$ using the Monte Carlo method with 10000 iterations. It calls the `print` method with the result and the actual answer of 3.21825.

### Notes

- Adjust the `NUM_ITERATIONS` constant in the `Main` class to change the precision of the approximation.
- The accuracy of the approximation increases with a larger number of iterations.

### Sample Output

```
cox(x + sin(x))dx from 0 to 5pi/7 = -0.485736, approximate = [approximateAnswer1]
dxdy / (x^2 + y^4) where 1 <= x^2 + y^2 <= 3 = 3.21825, approximate = [approximateAnswer2]
```

The actual values of the integrals are specified along with their respective approximations based on the Monte Carlo method.

## Linear System Solver using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (Lab 5)

This Python script solves a linear system of equations using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. It iterates through chains and lengths to approximate the solution. 

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. You'll also need `numpy` and `matplotlib` libraries.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib
    ```

### Usage

Run the Python script `main.py`:

```bash
main.py
```

### Details

The `solve_linear_system` function uses a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach to approximate the solution of a given linear system. 

- `coeff_matrix`: Coefficient matrix of the linear system.
- `constants`: Constants in the linear equations.
- `num_chains`: Number of chains for the MCMC.
- `chain_length`: Length of each chain.

Adjust the `coeff_matrix`, `constants`, `num_chains_set`, and `chain_length_set` variables in the script to test different scenarios.

### Example

Here's an example of usage:

```python
coeff_matrix = np.array([[1, 0, 0],
                         [0, 1, 0],
                         [0, 0, 1]])
constants = np.array([-3, 1, 4])

num_chains_set = [10, 30, 60, 100]
chain_length_set = [10, 100, 300, 1000]

# Run the solver
# (Add the code for running the solver here)
```

### Output

The script generates a plot showing the error in the computed solutions compared to the actual solutions for different numbers of chains and chain lengths.
